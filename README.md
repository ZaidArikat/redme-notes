New in 2016, the CT6 marked Cadillac’s return to the global prestige luxury segment, at the time the car touted as an entirely new approach to premium luxury. Updates for the 2019 model year are minimal, although Cadillac has cancelled the slow-selling Plug-In Hybrid edition and had already dropped the base 2.0 turbo four-cylinder. There are two engines available for CT6, topped by a 3.0L twin-turbo V6 putting out 404 horsepower and 400 pound-feet of torque. Its efficiency is enhanced with cylinder deactivation technology as well as a 10 speed automatic transmission. The base engine is a naturally aspirated 3.6L V6 available. Active-on-demand all-wheel drive is standard, constantly monitoring all four of the car’s wheels and makes adjustments for maximum traction in a wide range of challenging driving conditions.
